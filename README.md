# Generic Motion Planning Networks (MPNet) for MoveIt 2

This repository contains a version of the Motion Planning Networks (MPNet)
motion planner that integrates with the MoveIt 2 motion planning library and,
consequently, with the Robot Operating System (ROS) version 2.

The package depends on the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL), as well as the
code that integrates OMPL with MoveIt 2. The code is primarily based off of the
MPNet C++ library that was used to interface with the Baxter research robot
under ROS 1 and MoveIt!
